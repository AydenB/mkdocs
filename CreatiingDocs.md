Inefficient documented technology is indistinguishable from magic.

The goal of any documentation is to help people. "Good" documentation is useful. "Bad" documentation confuses readers and might physically harm people or damage equipment.

There are a few basic types of content structure:

    1. Narrative - A traditional documentation approach, such as system descriptions and tutorials.
    2. Reference - Such as specific component descriptions and glossaries.
    3. Task - Common with procedures and user guides.

Important with such projects is consistency. Often this is resolved with something known as a style guide. Style guides might be formal or informal. Often content management systems provide basic style attributes.

Included with consistency is terminology. Do not lazily call an order an order in one place and a ticket in another place -- use the technically correct term as applicable.

Target audience is important. Writing for a seasoned IT professional will presume understanding many terms and phrases, but a less knowledgeable audience will need those words and phrases explained. This type of audience analysis is called "skill of the craft."

For example, taking a server (virtual or hardware) that provides X service. What things make it into your documentation?

Possibly something like this:

    - Some kind of system description.
    - Information about configurations.
    - Information about alerts and notifications.
    - Links to related task procedures.
    - Links to disaster recovery procedures.

A common debate about such documentation is who is the target audience? When in doubt, regardless of subject matter expert (SME) egos, is write to the lowest common denominator. Often this means the newest support person or technician, somebody who is not yet familiar with the system or company but needs guidance to learn. Some SMEs "loathe" that kind of detail, but in a disaster that kind of detail will be much welcomed by the newest person stuck working the weekend rotation for the very first time.

Murphy's Law: "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." Often that means when the proverbial poop hits the fan, the event will happen when the SME is on vacation. Good documentation will help anybody faced with resolving the dilemma.
