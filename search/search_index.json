We interviewed and surveyed hundreds of customers and sifted through your website feedback over the years. It was clear we needed to make a change and create a modern web experience for content. The first thing we did was evaluate our existing content infrastructure. The prevous site was built on a 15 year-old brittle codebase with an archaic publishing and deployment system that was never designed to run on the cloud.</p> <p>Our focus was not only on the experience, but also on the content we create and how each of you consume it. For years customers have told us to go beyond walls of text with feature-level content and help them implement solutions to their business problems. We knew that the content we delivered and the platform we built must make it easy for customers to learn and deploy solutions.</p> <p>We realized that to get the overall experience right we needed to start from scratch; from this effort comes https://docs.cdrsoftware.com \u2013 a new hope for documentation at CDR.</p>"},{"location":"#key-features","title":"Key features","text":"<p>Let's start with an example documentation page shown below and we'll showcase some of the new features on the site. </p>"},{"location":"#readablity","title":"Readablity","text":"<p>To improve content readability, we changed the site to have a set content width. Eye tracking studies have shown that you can improve comprehension and reading speed with a set content width as it's difficult for the eye to follow long passages left-to-right.

We know many of you are learning/evaluating technology a few minutes between meetings and you're more likely to read articles if you knew how much of a time commitment is required. We also added date stamps to content to help customers understand how fresh the information is.</p>"},{"location":"#content-and-site-navigation","title":"Content and site navigation","text":"<p>One key area of investment based on customer feedback was improvements in site navigation, information architecture and content organization based on the customer's intent.
