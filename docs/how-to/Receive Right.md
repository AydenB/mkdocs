- To check the status, go to the "Work with RF Receiving" 5,8.
- Look for the option "F9 Receive Right Batches" to view all purchase orders sent to Receive Right.

### 2.2 Receiving and Updating

- Once the product is received and scanned by the recipients, the status will change to "C" for complete.
- Quantities and item counts will be displayed to confirm successful receipt.

## 3. Handling Changes to Sent Purchase Orders

### 4.2 Timing Considerations
